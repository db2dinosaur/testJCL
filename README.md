# testJCL
Some test JCL used when testing ZOA Utilities, Rocket Git and Jenkins Pipelines.

Nothing intentionally useful (sorry) on this one - just want to sort out pulling JCL libraries from Git to z/OS.

Worth noting the .gitattributes file, which highlights the different codepages, depending on where we are.

If it ends up being useful, I'll update this README ;-)
